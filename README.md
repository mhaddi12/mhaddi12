I'm a passionate **Flutter Developer** with over 2 years of experience, currently working at **BitLogicx**.

I love building mobile apps with clean UI, smooth user experiences, and high-performance features. Recently, I’ve also been expanding my backend expertise with **Node.js and Express** to create full-stack solutions.
